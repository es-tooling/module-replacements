# Moment.js

Moment.js has a large footprint and other, lighter alternatives exist.

> We now generally consider Moment to be a legacy project in maintenance mode. It is not dead, but it is indeed done.

# Alternatives

## Luxon

Luxon can be thought of as the evolution of Moment. It is authored by [Isaac Cambron](https://github.com/icambron), a long-time contributor to Moment. Please read [Why does Luxon exist?](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/why) and the [For Moment users](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/moment) pages in the Luxon documentation.

## Day.js

Day.js is designed to be a minimalist replacement for Moment.js, using a similar API. It is not a drop-in replacement, but if you are used to using Moment's API and want to get moving quickly, consider using Day.js.
