# Replacements for `rimraf`

## Node.js

Node.js v14.14.0 and above provide a native alternative: [`fs.rm`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fspromisesrmpath-options). It supports recursive deletion and works as a direct replacement.

```diff
- import rimraf from 'rimraf'
+ import { rm } from 'node:fs/promises'

- await rimraf('./dist')
+ await rm('./dist', { recursive: true, force: true })
```

## Node.js (before v14.14.0)

If you need to support Node.js 12 up to 14.13, you can use [`fs.rmdir`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fsrmdirpath-options-callback) with the recursive option. This was added in Node v12.10.0, though it’s deprecated as of Node v14.

```diff
- import rimraf from 'rimraf'
+ import { rmdir } from 'node:fs/promises'

- await rimraf('./dist')
+ await rmdir('./dist', { recursive: true })
```

## CLI usage

To replace `rimraf` inside npm scripts, you can run Node directly in eval mode:

```sh
node -e "require('fs').rmSync('./dist', { recursive: true, force: true, maxRetries: process.platform === 'win32' ? 10 : 0 })"
```

## `premove`

If you are on an older Node.js version (before v12.10) or you specifically need a CLI replacement, you can use [`premove`](https://github.com/lukeed/premove). It provides both an API and a CLI and works on Node.js v8 and newer.

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
-    "clean": "rimraf lib",
+    "clean": "premove lib"
  }
}
```
