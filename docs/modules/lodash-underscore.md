# `lodash` / `underscore`

`lodash` and `underscore` have not been updated for many years and almost all methods can be replaced with modern JavaScript built-in methods, the rest - with simple helpers.

Extracted from `lodash` packages like `lodash.%methodname%` are not maintained, deprecated, haven't been updated for many more years, and a part of them have significant security issues and bugs. They are no longer safe for usage.

The same situation with custom `lodash` builds like `lodash-es`.
