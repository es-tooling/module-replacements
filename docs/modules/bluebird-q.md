# `bluebird` / `q`

[`bluebird`](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8Fnote%EF%B8%8F) and [`q`](https://github.com/kriskowal/q#note) recommends that you switch away from them to native promises.

# Alternatives

## Native JavaScript `Promise`

For most cases, native JavaScript `Promise` is enough.
